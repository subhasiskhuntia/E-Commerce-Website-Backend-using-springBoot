# E-Commerce-Website-Backend-using-springBoot
Backend of the project is build with spring boot

Frontend of this application: https://github.com/subhasiskhuntia/E-Commerece-Website-using-angular

 I built this website with Angular as the frontend and Springboot as the backend. For the CSS, I utilised Bootstrap and MaterialUI. I utilised JWT tokens for authentication and JAVA mailer for email verification in my application, and I integrated the Razorpay payment gateway. Any ideas or suggestions are appreciated.
